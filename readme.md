## Python How-many-times-can-you-guess-the-number game

number guessing game built with python

did this as part of my SchoolofIT course

it requires the user to enter any number from 1 to 10

# requirements

python 3.8+

python json module: pip install json

# to run

make sure you have the python interpreter installed in your system
to play the game, open the file in your terminal by typing "py Game.py" on windows
or "python Game.py" on mac and linux


# The desired structure of the program:
    # X means not completed, Y means completed

    > Start the program with an introduction.   X
    > Explain what actions can be taken.    X
    > The computer makes a choice and the user makes a choice.    X
    > The choices are compared to see if they match.    X
    > If they match count 1 to the score, otherwise return to the beginning of the program.     X
    > Give the user the option to exit the program at any moment they wish to do so.    X
    > Display the score to the user.    X
    > Keep track of the user's highest score in a json file so they may always come back and challenge themselves or their friends. Use a seperate python file to perform this task.    X
    > Add or keep track of a LICENSE file, a .gitignore file and a README file.     X

    > If possible, after getting the program to fully functional in the terminal, introduce a GUI version of the program.   X


# When uploading changes to the program, please do testing first in the sandbox branch before releasing to the main branch!
